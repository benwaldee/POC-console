## üéõÔ∏è Running the admin panel

Since the panel is not currently deployed, it is recommended to run the application locally. Permissions have been set on API Gateway to allow HTTP requests to be sent via Axios from local environments.

1. Ensure that you are at the top level in your CLI ( `/POC-console` )
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to use the admin panel.

**Note:** Changes made to the code *should* update live in the browser, but if you are not seeing a change just reload the page.
